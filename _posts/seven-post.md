# Speed Running Agile Learning

## Random Information Gleaned From Random Sources

### Agile Manifesto (the important bits)

<https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html/>

- Early and continuous delivery
- Welcome changing requirements even late in development
- Deliver working software frequently
- Business & developers should be working together **daily**
- Working software is the primary measure of progress
- The art of maximizing the work *not done* is essential
- Self-organizing teams
- Regularly reflecting on ways of improving

### Agile (Wikipedia)

Interestingly Wikipedia claims that empirical evidence is difficult to find in regards to Agile improving software development.

Found this a link to this Agile Glossary <https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/agile-glossary/>

XP, Scrum, and a number of other random dead ideas all fall under the original bubble of Agile.

### Kent Beck Embracing Change With Extreme Programming

Interesting ideas/useful things to remember

- A customer sits with the team full time
- Continuous integration
  - new code is integrated with the system after a few hours. The system is built from scratch and all tests must pass.
- Collective ownership
  - every programmer improves code anywhere in the system if they see the opportunity.

A lot of emphasis is put on the "customer" picking what stories are being worked on and what is going into the release

The period before a system is in production is dangerous and should be gotten over as quickly as possible.

Development cycle is broken down into 4 distinct parts
- Analysis
- Design
- Implementation
- Testing

There is an interesting analogy made about how to decide what goes into a *release* which I think can be thought of like a sprint in this context. Kent Beck says to think of it like going shopping with $100 in your pocket. Ultimately you're going to pick the items you can afford with that money. When it comes to picking stories the price is the estimate.

Stories are from the customer. Tasks are derived from the stories by the developers. As soon as a task is finished it's immediately integrated with the main code-base.
