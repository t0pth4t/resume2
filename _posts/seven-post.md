# Speed Running Agile Learning

## Agile Manifesto (the important bits)

<https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html/>

- Early and continuous delivery
- Welcome changing requirements even late in development
- Deliver working software frequently
- Business & developers should be working together **daily**
- Working software is the primary measure of progress
- The art of maximizing the work *not done* is essential
- Self-organizing teams
- Regularly reflecting on ways of improving

## Agile (Wikipedia)

Interestingly Wikipedia claims that empirical evidence is difficult to find in regards to Agile improving software development.

Found this a link to this Agile Glossary <https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/agile-glossary/>

XP, Scrum, and a number of other random dead ideas all fall under the original bubble of Agile.
