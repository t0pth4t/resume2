## Hacking my way to a better life

What happens if you do (mostly) everything "right"?

Over the past several months I have generally given up on any semblance of self-improvement or self-care. The reasons behind this do not matter much but I believe my lack of motivation and general mood have been significantly impacted by this.

This has driven me to the point where I am curious and motivated to experiment on myself and see what happens if I follow, relatively strictly, all of the things that are generally recommended for a healthy lifestyle.

## The Plan

Brainstorming the things that I believe will have the most impact on my life, I came up with the following list:

New routines to add to my life:

- Regular cardiovascular exercise (3-4 times a week) ideally in the morning
- Regular strength training (3-4 times a week) ideally in the morning
- Regular meditation (3-4 times a week) in the morning or before bed
- Get at least 8 hours of sleep every night
- Read for at least 30 minutes every day (ideally before bed)

Consumption habits to add to my life:

- Replace all drinks with water
- Replace snacks with whole unprocessed foods

Things to remove from my life:

- No alcohol
- No caffeine after 2 pm
- No screens after 10 pm

Things to limit:

- Limit intake of artificial sweeteners
- Limit intake of processed foods
- Limit mindless consumption of media (youtube, reddit, hacker news, etc)

Ambitious goals but not necessary:

- Work on side projects again
- Learn new skills (non-tech related)
  - Guitar, juggling, etc
- Learn new tech skills
  - AI/ML stuff

## How to monitor/evaluate progress

- Use Fitbit data and stress functionality
- Regularly log subjective well-being (keep this outside of Blog)
-

## Setting a baseline/starting point

In the interest of privacy, I will track my well-being and health metrics outside of the public sphere.

In summary though, as a baseline, my general physical health is fair to average while my subjective well-being is poor to fair. The primary areas I am hoping to improve are mood, energy, and focus.
