# Becoming a Scrum Master

## Stuff from some random Redditor

- Learn how to lead productive meetings from the background
  - make sure everyone has a voice
  - make sessions fun and valuable
- Psychological safety is key
  - look into project Aristotle (the google perfect team project)
- Need to learn to be a conflict resolver
- Get good at root cause analysis
- Outputs vs. outcomes
  - look into Jeff Patton
- Challenge assumptions

## Another nice post from a random Redditor about being a Product Owner

1. Don't always be a Proxy for the customer
   - You are the product **owner**, so when the team has functional questions you should be able to answer them.
2. Stakeholders must have a voice
   - Stakeholders have to be involved even when you think you know it all. Stakeholders can check your assumptions or validate them.
3. Your work is never done
   - Just because you are finished with sprint planning, backlog refinement, etc..., does not mean you should check out from the team.
4. Keep simplicity top of mind
   - MVPs, stripped-down features, and the smallest possible deliverables are your friend. Simplicity does not mean skimping on quality, if anything it means the quality should be higher.
5. Listen to developers
6. **All stories are done but the feature is not complete**
   - This is something to watch out for.
7. Check your metrics

## Misc.

Purpose, Autonomy, and Mastery are what keep people motivated. Knowing what you are working on matters and is contributing to something meaningful is purpose. Having the autonomy to make your own decisions is autonomy. And having pride in high-quality solutions is mastery.

### Scrum

- Closing out a sprint is a way for the team to feel as if they are making real tangible progress on a regular basis. This is in contrast to working on long drawn-out projects that are not delivering on anything.
- Walking the board is an alternative to the three questions from stand-up.
- I forgot we used to do this at Baird. The 16th minute. A way of chatting about stuff that was getting off topic.
- Technically anyone in the team can run the retro
